# Sample App for querying database within Embedded Documents

## Author
Meghana Dhage

## Type
Getting Started

## Level
Beginner

## Product Version
v3.4 and up 

## What You’ll Build
Java application to illustrate different find queries on Embedded Documents to retrieve data from the MongoDB database. The four methods you will be exploring are:
* Equality match on a single nested field
* Equality match on two nested fields
* Use of an operator on a nested field ($gt)
* Equality match that uses a nested field and one or more fields that are not nested

## Time Required
7 - 10 minutes to install and run the sample app

## What You’ll Need
1. [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html)
2. [MongoDB Java Driver v3.6](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/)
3. MongoDB instance. Either local or set up one for free on Mongo cloud [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
4. Create mongoDB collection “stores.order”

## Check Your Environment
1. Check for Java installation and Java driver dependency set up.

## Considerations (optional)
1. Get the correct connection string to your MongoDB instance.

## Procedure
1. Download the files EmbeddedDocumentsQuery.java and the test file mbeddedDocumentsQueryTest.java 
2. Build the project.
3. Refer [README documentation](https://github.com/mongodb/sample-apps-nyu/blob/master/EmbeddedDocumentsQuery/README.md) for the code explanation
