## Type
Getting started.

## Level
Begineer.

## Product Version
v3.4 and up.

## What You'll Build
Java app to import example dataset on to MongoDB database.

## Time Required 
2 minutes.

## What You'll Need
1. Java 8.
2. [MongoDB Java Driver v3.6](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/).
3. MongoDB instance. Either local or set up one for free on Mongo cloud [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
4. Download exampleDataset.json.

## Check Your Environment
1. Check for Java installation and Java driver dependency set up.

## Consideration
1. Get the correct connection string to your MongoDB instance.
2. Get the correct file path on your local machine to ExampleDataset.json.
3. Make sure MongoDB Java libraries are set up appropriately and are accessible at run time.

## Procedure
1. Build the project. Preferably, as a runnable jar including all the neccessary libraries. Runnable jar file would require a run configuration. Set up one for this project by selecting the appropriate main method.
2. Use the following command to import the example dataset on to your MondoDB instance.
```
java -jar InsertExampleDataset.jar <Connection String> exampleDataset.json
```
